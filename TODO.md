### **1. Plan**
#### Pages/Components:
   -  **Home Page**: Introduction and navigation to gambling/trading sections.
   -  **Gambling Section**: List of games (e.g., Coin Toss, Dice Roll, Blackjack).
   - **Trading Section**: A dashboard for stock simulation with buy/sell features.
   -  **Account Page**: Display user balance, transaction history, and options to request more currency.
   -  **Authentication**: Login and registration forms.

---

### **2. Core Features**
#### Gambling Section:
   -  Start with a simple game like a coin toss (50/50 win-loss chance).
   -  Gradually add more complex games, such as card-based games (e.g., Blackjack).

#### Trading Section:
   - Use a stock market API to fetch mock stock data.
   - Let users simulate buying/selling stocks.
   - Display a portfolio summary with "current value" vs. "initial investment."

#### Backend:
   -  Firebase Authentication: For user login and account creation.
   -  Firebase Firestore/Realtime Database: To store:
     - User account details (name, email, balance).
     - Transaction history for trading and gambling results.

---

### **3. Design with React**
#### UI Libraries:
   -  Use **react-bootstrap** for responsive design (e.g., Navbar, cards, modals).
   -  Add **react-icons** for playful and visually engaging buttons/icons.

---

### **4. Firebase Integration**
#### Authentication:
   -  Implement email/password-based signup and login.
   -  Optionally, allow Google or social media login for ease.

#### Database:
   -  Store user details like:
     - `uid`
     - Balance (in-game currency).
     - Gambling/trading history.

#### Rules:
   -  Set Firebase security rules to protect user data. (It makes it difficult to implement leaderboards)

---

### **5. Optional Features**
   - **Leaderboard**: Rank users based on their net earnings.
   -  **Daily Bonus**: Offer daily fake currency rewards to encourage logins.
   -  **Dark Mode**: Use React state to toggle between light and dark themes.
   - **Animations**: Add small animations to enhance the user experience.

---

### **6. Milestones**
1.  Set up the project and Firebase backend.
2.  Build basic pages and navigation (Home, Login, etc.).
3.  Implement the gambling section with at least one simple game.
4. Add the trading section with basic stock data fetching and transactions.
5. Polish the UI and test interactions between components and Firebase.
